==== How To Approach Compose-MP

* Use "Compose for Web/JS" now, Compose for Web/Wasm sometime in 2024.
* Check required functionality for your use cases.
* Check if bundle sizes meet your requirements.

=== WebAssembly (Wasm)

* Still early, lacks library support, but moving fast.

==== Kotlin and Browser Support for Integrated Garbage Collector

* Kotlin support in 1.9.20
* Chrome Stable: November 2023
* Firefox Stable: November 2023
* Safari: Unknown (there is WIP in WebKit, release in months?)

==== Other Browser Developments

* Wasm Multithreading on its way along the 5-phase standardization process.

==== Servers

* WebAssembly VM with microsecond startup time about to become the most attractive virtualization runtime.
* Initial WASI (WebAssembly System Interface) support in Kotlin 1.9.20.

=== How To Approach KMP

* Just Do It.
* At your pace. No all-in commitment.
* Native where you want it.
* KMP where you want it, when you want it.
* Let examples inspire you / Try stuff / Don't blindly follow "recipes" / Check what works for you.
* Don't worry about reliability: Experimental, Alpha, Beta are (mostly) about https://kotlinlang.org/docs/components-stability.html[API stability].
* Use Multiplatform libraries where available (easier to use, allow expanding to other platforms later).
* Get in touch with the community (kotlinlang Slack).

== Additional Material

Some background information on everything Kotlin Multiplatform. And everything I would have liked to talk about, but could not fit into that talk.

NOTE: While I believe that stuff mentioned here is valuable, I do not necessarily endorse everything. So I ask you to just find out what works well in your context, given your background and preferences.

=== Curated Resources

There is lots of stuff out there. You'll find so many opportunities to inspire you and learn from. Even if that means learning from less-than-ideal solutions.

NOTE: My take: Many solutions out there are unnecessarily complicated (yes, that's possible even in Kotlin). So try to find the well-designed ones that are complete, yet simple!
